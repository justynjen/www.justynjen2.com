            <h3 class="text-right">Summer 2015</h3>
            <p class="text-right">In 2015 I made the courageous decision to drop out of college and travel half way around the world by myself for the first time. This is when my blog, Adventures of a middle child was born. What started as a way to keep my family up to date on my whereabouts, turned into a life long passion for travel.</p>

            <h3 class="text-left">Winter 2016</h3>
            <p class="text-left">This was a pivitol point in my life. In Winter of 2016 I sat down with my parents and we decided together that travel is going to be what I do. I was not going back to college, I was moving forward and I was not only terrified, but so so excited</p>

            <h3 class="text-right">Spring 2017</h3>
            <p class="text-right">In April of 2017 I was accepted to a Blogging course with Institute of Code and the BlondeAbroad. This changed everything for me, I was so excited to be a part of the course and learn all the ins and outs of blogging that I had been missing out on over the past two years of travel.</p>

            <h3 class="text-left">Summer 2017</h3>
            <p class="text-left">At the start of the summer I was packing up everything I own selling everything that I didn't need anymore and packing what was left into a backpack to get on a plane to Bali. The course was starting just a few weeks into June and the plan was to stay in Bali after. During the course I signed up to learn to code as well. Now I have all the skills of a front-end developer to continue on my path towards being a full time digital nomad.</p>
